# Networking Utilities

The goal of this Repository is to make it easy for
us to write an iptables sink module into KPNG, 
https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kpng/ 

The name monad is originated from greek ['μονάς'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_%28philosophy%29). The network traffic processing is complex, the intention of this project is to bring some simple primitive in this realm, and make the reasoning for networking easier.
